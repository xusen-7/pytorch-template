# PyTorch Template
> A clear PyTorch template for swift model building.

## Features
+ [x] Well-organized project template out of the box.
+ [x] Automatically record the model version (by saving the git commit hash) for later reproduction.
+ [x] Automatically start TensorBoard for you.
+ [x] Use JSON file or command line arguments to specify arguments.
+ [x] The results of each experiment are properly stored.


## Steps For Using This Template
1. Modifiy the model structures `models/build.py`.
2. Update the loss functions used `solver/loss.py`.
3. Update the data loading process `data/dataset.py` & `data/loader.py`.
4. Add metrics that can measure your model's performance `metrics/eval.py`.
5. Update sampling functions & logging functions so you can see the results with TensorBoard `solver/solver.py`!
6. Add a shell script that run your model `scripts/{exp_id}-model_key_config.sh`.
7. Start training, evaluating or inferencing by running the above script!

## Others
I referred [StarGAN v2's official implementation](https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2) when crafting this template, 
so don't be surprised if you find some code is similar.

BTW, if you want to deploy your model, you may want to check out [this template](https://github.com/songquanpeng/pytorch-deployment).
